## Lesson 1: Welcome to CV

### Spatially Coherent data: 

Spatial coherency: techniques useful for any data

Spatially coherent data: any data that oredictable varies over space,like sound

### 3 main areas of CV discussed in this course:

1. Foundational math and programming concepts behind pattern recognition in classification tasks:
   
   creating algorithms that can 
   - isolate important distinguishing information (eg object's hape and colour) about an object in an image.
   - how to ignore irrelevant parts of an image like plane background or noise

2. Deep Learning Algorithms (SOTA in CV Technology)

   Region based CNN - identifies where an object is in an image
   Models using RNN - applications that aim to reach human levels of scene understanding

3. Object Tracking and Localization Techniques:

   Using spatial information gathered over time, learn about  predicting the location of an object
   and determining its movement.
   
   Ongoing field of research - especially in the field of autonomous vechicles - self
   driving cars and drones.

### Computer Vision Course Overview

This Nanodegree program is broken into three main sections:

1. **Intro to Computer Vision**, which covers topics like image processing, feature 
extraction done manually or through training a convolutional neural network (CNN) using PyTorch.

2. **Advanced Computer Vision and Deep Learning**, which is all about advances in deep learning 
architectures like region-based CNN's, YOLO and single-shot detection algorithms, and CNN's 
used in combination with recurrent neural networks.

3. **Object Tracking and Localization**, which covers how a robot can move and sense the 
world around it, creating a visual representation of the world as it navigates.
