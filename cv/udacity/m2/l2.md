# YOLO (You Only Look Once)

- real time object detection algorithm
- avoids speding too much time on generating region proposals, instead
    prioritizes speed and recognition.
- merge class and bounding box coordinates into single output vector.
  $$
  \begin{bmatrix}
  p_c\\c_1\\c_2\\.\\.\\.\\c_N\\x\\y\\w\\h\end{bmatrix}$$

  where,
  
  $p_c$ probability that object exists within the window

  $c_k's$ are class probabilities


## Generating bounding boxes

- Assign the ground truth bounding box for one object in the image to only one
    grid cell in the training image. So, only one gird cell is meant to locate
    the object. 

- For each training image,
  - Locate the mid point of each object in the image
  - Assign the true bounding box to grid cell that contains that mid point.
  - x and y - center of bounding box relative to the grid cell
  - w and h - width and height of the box relative to the whole image. 
  -

## Non Maximal Supression

- handle multiple grid cell vectors and multiple bounding boxes for the same
    object.
- uses Intersection over Union (IoU). Ideally, it must be 1.
