# Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM)

## GRAPH SLAM Method - easiest method for SLAM

We wish to maximize the likelihood of the position $x_1$ given $x_0$.
GRAPH SLAM defines the probabilities using a sequence of constraints like:

- Initial Location Constraint
- Relative Motion Constraints (relates robot pose to previous robot pose)
- Relative Measurement Constraints

GRAPH SLAM collects these constraints (easy to collect), uses them to find the
most likely configuration of robot path along with the location of landmarks,
which is called mapping process.

$\mu = \Omega^{-1} \xi$
